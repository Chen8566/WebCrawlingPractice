This is a simple python script I wrote to download 
web novels.

I have successfully download three novels via this script:

  * [吃瓜观众的重生日记](https://www.boluoxs.com/biquge/35/35352/)
  * [凡人修仙之仙界篇](https://www.boluoxs.com/biquge/2/2000/)
  * [混天神皇](https://www.boluoxs.com/biquge/34/34631/)
   
   

PS:
I am self-learning web crawling right now,
if anyone who find some interesting stuff and don't mind sharing it, 
feel free to contact me and we could make friends and learn together :)
